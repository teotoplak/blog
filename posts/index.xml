      <description>This post is about a life-long career goal I&amp;rsquo;m setting for myself.
The goal is: I will serve one million people with a net positive impact on the world in a personally sustainable way.
 A reachable goal is a clear goal. That is why I need to define this goal more clearly:

      <description>The Evolution Gap Two hundred thousand years ago, Homo sapiens were walking with a relatively similar brain to one we currently have in our heads. If you would take a baby from thousands of years ago, it would grow indistinguishable from other people in present surroundings. Our brain physiology didn&amp;rsquo;t change much. But our environment changed drastically.
For example, in Homo Sapiens age you would need to make decisions about where and how to find food.</description>
